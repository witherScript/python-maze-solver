# Maze Solver

This project is an implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for solving mazes. It uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## Overview

The program creates a window with a maze, represented by a grid. A basic breadth-first search algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the start point to the end point of the maze.
